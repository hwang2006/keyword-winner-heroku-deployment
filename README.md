# keyword-winner-heroku-deployment
This repository serves as a step-by-step guide for connecting your GitHub repository to Heroku, enabling seamless app deployment on the Heroku platform. Heroku is a cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage web applications. It provides a streamlined workflow for application deployment, making it easier for developers to focus on coding rather than managing infrastructure.
